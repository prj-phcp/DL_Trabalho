Currently, more complex downhole monitoring and control systems are being installed in what are often called "Intelligent Wells." Reliability is a critical aspect for all these systems.We evaluated the performance of 952 pressure- and temperaturemonitoring systems installed since 1987. The 5-year survival probability of these systems improved from 40\\% for systems installed in the period 1987â€“88 to 75\\% for the period 1991â€“92. No further improvements have been observed from 1992, resulting in a 5-year survival probability of 69\\% for the period 1993â€“98.Failure modes have been evaluated and could be attributed primarily to the downhole gauge and to the cable. Based on these findings, recommendations have been made to achieve reliability improvements.}",

    abstract = "{The accurate metering of flow rates across the production chain, from sandface to sales point or custody transfer point is of vital importance. With the use of multiphase flowmeters (MPFMs), measurement of multiphase flow under dynamic conditions is possible. In well tests, the assurance of optimal flowmeter performance is of great importance because test results can significantly impact long-term field development planning and well management. We highlight the integrated approach implemented to improve flowmetering performance for a new oilfield offshore UAEIn offshore fields, MPFMs have been installed on production towers to measure production of individual wells. In the first phase of field development, commingled flow from all wells is also metered at the outlet of the manifold tower (MFT) before entering the subsea line to the processing facility. The installed MPFMs eliminate the need for traditional test separators or dedicated test vessels. However, since multiphase flow is complex, turbulent, and chaotic, the acquisition of accurate, reliable, and repeatable rate measurements can be a challenge. Fiscal measurements must also meet statutory requirements for accuracy in hydrocarbon accounting and production allocation. We present the case study of a new field, the initial challenges encountered in achieving quality test data, and the systematic approach established to streamline flowmeter performance. This approach comprises representative fluids description, results validation, and calculation model optimization, which has resulted in improved performance of wellhead and MFT flowmeters.The process of streamlining flowmeter performance verification and optimizing flowmeter utilization to track individual well performance has resulted in cost savings and improved production optimization. Well-specific pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) models have provided optimal conversion of line conditions to standard conditions, with reduced uncertainties introduced by pressure, temperature, and effluent variations. As a consequence, ideal production allocation factors were achieved, yielding confidence in the use of well test data for production and reservoir management purposes. An added benefit is the increased confidence in the data quality for history matching of the dynamic model. Effective production monitoring as new production streams from different reservoirs come on line has enhanced production reconciliation due to reduced uncertainty from commingled flow and improved production forecasting.The principles employed in multiphase flow measurement technology are not new. However, real-time, accurate flow rate measurements are essential for good decision-making, sound engineering analysis, and effective life-of-well management. The application of a case-by-case approach to flowmeter configuration, combined with an efficient monitoring approach, has proved very valuable to achievement of effective reservoir monitoring and well management.}",

   abstract = {In the past, the problem of predicting the multiphase flow rate in producing wells has been tackled using the Gilbert correlation. The Gilbert correlation offers a quick solution and requires quantities that are readily available at the surface, making it a staple among solutions in many publications. However, the correlation is limited in applicability to local data, and in some cases, multiple parameter settings are required when flow conditions change. To address these points, we introduced a systematic comparison of applying Gilbert correlation and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to the problem of liquid flow prediction. We determined that some of the issues, specifically the need for multiple models, can be alleviated using DL methods. In this work, available wellhead measurements that can be collected at surface were used in modeling their relationship to well production rate. In addition, features were extracted automatically using autoencoders to generate additional inputs. The algorithms used for forecasting were designed using standard and customized DL architectures. The results of both DL and existing solutions from the literature were compared systematically to determine the usefulness of the DL methodology developed. The study developed a novel methodology for forecasting well liquid and multiphase restricted flow rate using wellhead surface measurements and demonstrated the application to real field data. The method was found to be an efficient utilization of data that are readily available and do not require well intervention to measure.},

One such case is an oil production platform in which reservoir conditions and the composition of the multiphase flow are not precisely known. Today, with streams of data generated from sensors, black-box adaptive control emerged as an alternative to control such systems. In this work, we employed an online adaptive controller based on Echo State Networks (ESNs) in diverse scenarios of controlling an oil production platform. The ESN learns an inverse model of the plant from which a control law is derived to attain set-point tracking of a simulated model. The analysis considers high steady-state gains, potentially unstable conditions, and a multi-variate control structure. All in all, this work contributes to the literature by demonstrating that online-learning control can be effective in highly complex dynamic systems (oil production platforms) devoid of suitable models, and with multiple inputs and outputs.}

The device installed in order to measure this variable is often called a Permanent Downhole Gauge (PDG). Replacing a faulty PDG is often not economically viable and to have an alternative estimate of the downhole pressure is an important goal. Using data from operating PDGs, this paper describes a number of issues dealt with in the development of soft sensors for several deepwater gas-lifted oil wells. Some of the tested models include nonlinear polynomials, neural networks, committee machines, unscented Kalman filters and filter banks. The variety of model classes used in addition to the diversity of oil wells considered brings to light some of the key-problems that have to be faced and reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each alternative solution. A major constraint throughout the work was the use of historical data, hence no specific tests were performed at any time. The aim of this work is to discuss the procedures, pros and cons of the tested solutions and to point to possible future directions of research.},

   abstract = {When the dynamical data of a system only convey dynamic information over a limited operating range, the identification of models with good performance over a wider operating range is very unlikely. To overcome such a shortcoming, this paper describes a methodology to train models from dynamical data andsteady-state information, which is assumed available. The novelty is that the procedure can be applied to models with rather complex structures such as multilayer perceptron neural networks in a bi-objective fashion without the need to compute fixed points neither analytically nor numerically. As a consequence, the required computing time is greatly reduced. The capabilities of the proposed method are explored in numerical examples and the development of soft-sensors for downhole pressure estimation for a real deep-water offshore oil well. The results indicate that the procedure yields suitable soft-sensors with good dynamical andstatic performance and, in the case of models that are nonlinear in the parameters, the gain in computation time is about three orders of magnitude considering existing approaches.},

   abstract = {The permanent downhole gauge (PDG) pressure is the most important variable to describe the dynamics of an offshore oil well. Unfortunately, this measurement is often unavailable due to premature sensor failure and the considerable price for its replacement. An alternative to dealing with the lack of the PDG pressure measurement is its estimation. For this, Kalman filters are common tools, with which two distinct state estimators (extended and unscented Kalman filters) were proposed in the literature. These approaches have disadvantages related to the requirement for system linearization and the high computational cost, bringing the necessity for new techniques. In this work, five different Kalman filter-based approaches are tested and compared for the PDG pressure estimation. Through simulated and industrial data, the advantages and disadvantages of each filter are pointed. The results broadly show that the cubature Kalman filter returns the best estimation in the industrial case study, in which the model was properly adjusted. Meanwhile, the extended filters have the best performance in the simulated scenarios, considering that the model was not properly adjusted. In addition, the estimation using a single measurement that is highly correlated to the PDG pressure is enough for its estimation.},

   abstract = {Production prediction in petroleum industry plays a significant role in designing the strategy of the exploration and development. However, due to the complex and uncertain underground formations, it is difficult to obtain accurate forecasts. Most of the recent neural network studies on predicting the production rate in reservoirs are limited in optimizing the network models' parameters and reducing the significant computational cost during the training process. To address these issues, we develop a novel echo-state network (ESN) with attention mechanism to forecast the well performance based on production data. Firstly, in the training stage of the ESN model, we used the attention mechanism to extract the relevant features from contextual production rate; secondly, a dimensionality reduction procedure of the reservoir is carried out; thirdly, the generalization capability of the ESN model will be increased significantly by using the regularization constraints; finally, the generic algorithm will be employed in the validation process to optimize the hyperparameters of network. Five cases were carried out to validate the prediction performance of the presented approach. The comparisons with existing deep learning methods and decline curve analysis (DCA) models were implemented. The obtained results indicate that our built model is significantly superior to other deep learning and DCA approaches currently available in the literature. The approach presented in this paper is not only developed to forecast the short-term well performance, but also the production rate reconstructed and predicted using the new method can be employed to estimate missing flow history.},

    abstract={Forecasting of production in unconventional prospects has gained a lot of attention in the recent years. The key challenges in unconventional reservoirs have been the requirement to put online a) a large number of wells in a short period of time, b) well productivity significantly driven by completion characteristics and that c) the physics of fluid flow in these prospects still remain uncertain. In this paper, machine learning algorithms are used to forecast production for existing and new wells in unconventional assets using inputs like geological maps, production history, pressure data and operational constraints. One of the most popular Machine Learning methods – Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed for this purpose. ANN can learn from large volume of data points without assuming a predetermined model and can adapt to newer data as and when it becomes available. The workflow involves using these data sets to train and optimize the ANN model which, subsequently, is used to predict the well production performance of both existing wells using their own history and new wells by using the history of nearby wells which were drilled in analogous geological locations. The proposed technique requires users to do less data conditioning and model building and focus more on analyzing what-if scenarios and determining the well performance.},

   abstract = {Background and Objectives: Many real-world problems are time series forecasting (TSF) problem. Therefore, providing more accurate and flexible forecasting methods have always been a matter of interest to researchers. An important issue in forecasting the time series is the predicated time interval.Methods: In this paper, a new method is proposed for time series forecasting that can make more accurate predictions at larger intervals than other existing methods. Neural networks are an effective tool for estimating time series due to their nonlinearity and their ability to be used for different time series without specific information of those.  A variety of neural networks have been introduced so far, some of which have been used in forecasting time series.  Encoder decoder Networks are an example of networks that can be used in time series forcasting. an encoder network encodes the input data based on a particular pattern and then a decoder network decodes the output based on the encoded input to produce the desired output. Since these networks have a better understanding of the context, they provide a better performance. An example of this type of network is transformer.  A transformer neural network based on the self-attention is presented that has special capability in forecasting time series problems.Results: The proposed model has been evaluated through experimental results on two benchmark real-world TSF datasets from different domain. The experimental results states that, in terms of long-term estimation Up to eight times more resistant and in terms of estimation accuracy about 20 percent improvement, compare to other well-known methods, is obtained. Computational complexity has also been significantly reduced.Conclusion: The proposed tool could perform better or compete with other introduced methods with less computational complexity and longer estimation intervals. It was also found that with better configuration of the network and better adjustment of attention, it is possible to obtain more desirable results in any specific problem.},
